- 👋 Hi, I’m @noviceSam
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, especially AWS, and I have some knowledge of working with Wireshark, Nessus & Nmap!
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing to re-certify at cloud practitioner level, and then pursue Solutions Architect Associate certification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with AWS...even if it is only to create an S3 bucket or two! Any opportunity to put what I've learned into practice would be greatly appreciated.
- 📫 How to reach me ... carnmoneysam@gmail.com.
